# moderation-bot/README.md

Welcome to the moderation Discord bot project!

This project aims to create a moderation Discord bot that helps server administrators manage and moderate their Discord community effectively. The bot will have features such as auto-moderation, custom commands, logging, and user management tools.

To achieve this, we will be using Python as the programming language and the Discord API. The main features will be implemented in the following files:

- `bot.py`: This file will contain the main bot logic, including event handling and command execution.
- `auto_moderation.py`: This file will handle auto-moderation features such as filtering out inappropriate content.
- `custom_commands.py`: This file will manage custom commands that users can create and use.
- `user_management.py`: This file will handle user management features such as banning and kicking users.
- `logging.py`: This file will handle logging events and activities within the Discord server.

Additionally, we will have a `config.py` file in the `config` directory to manage bot configurations and a `permissions.json` file to store user permissions.

Please refer to the individual files for detailed implementation and functionality.

Thank you for choosing this Discord bot project! Let's make Discord communities safer and more enjoyable together.
